# Sam Childers

**New Software Developer**

I graduated from CPP or Cal Poly Pomona (California State Polytechnic University, Pomona). 
I programmed robots for around 10 years through FIRST Tech Challenge as a student participant and later a volunteer.
I am currently invested in learing about data managment and have learned MySQL and some NoSQL languages.
